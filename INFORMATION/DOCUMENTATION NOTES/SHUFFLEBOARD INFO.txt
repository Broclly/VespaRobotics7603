TOUR OF SHUFFLEBOARD:

Shuffleboard is a certain type of dashboard available in the FRC Driver Station, dashboard 
config. Shuffleboard uses custom widgets that are laid out on a grid. You can change the way the grid looks 
in size, layouts, and how the widgets are displayed. Widgets can be dragged and dropped into wherever you 
see fit in the grid. You can also turn off the grid itself in order for it to work! Shuffleboard also contains graph widget
which can track numeric data. You can also write your own custom widgets. (more on that later)


On the top right, you can see the sources, where you can view raw data output. Next to the sources tab
is also the widgets tab, which have some widgets that display information for you.

In the middle you can see the tabs area which displays the current widgets that are being used. Above that, 
you can see the different tabs that are selectable. These tabs can hold different widgets such as gyroscope info,
camera stream, accelorometer data, and much more!

On the bottom, you have recording tools, which are useful for playing back information that is gathered during a certain session.

DISPLAYING ROBOT INFO:

Shuffleboard allows the use of displaying information that is outputted from the robot, such as gyroscope data, 
swerve angles, speed data, and bridge angles. Displaying this info is incredibly easy to see and view by using shuffleboard,
as it uses GUI that updates actively, and shows information in a way that makes sense.

This information can be grabbed in normal operating modes (such as auto or teleop) by invoking various different SmartDashboard 
methods. For example, using the method, "SmartDashboard.putNumber("Left Drive Encoder", drivetrain.getLeftEncoder());", you get a helpful
GUI widget that shows that data.

Displaying information can be as easy as 123 if you remember what method you need to call for specific types, for example
numeric types such as "char", "int", "long", "float", or "double" require you to call the "SmartDashboard.putNumber(dashboard-name,value);"
method in order for it to work, string uses the same but "putString" instead of "putNumber" and boolean types require
"putBoolean" instead. 

As well you can use Shuffleboard to change how the type of data is displayed by right clicking on any GUI display,
and clicking "Show as" to display various different options. Play around with these options in order to find out which works best
for what.
