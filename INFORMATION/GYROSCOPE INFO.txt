Gyroscope Documentation:

-------------

The ADXRS450 Gyroscope Board (gyroscope currently on robot) can be plugged directly into the RoboRIO board
and displays voltage information based on rotation values. 

Rotation values are displayed in degrees/sec rather than exact values of rotation. This means equations must be run in order
to get specific values rather than reading a specific value. 

-------------

Running the code: "SmartDashboard.putNumber("Gyro", gyro.getRotation2d().getDegrees());" while having Shuffleboard active, with the ADXRS450
gyroscope attached onto the SPI port of the roboRIO, you can use right click on the gyro info in the sources tab.
