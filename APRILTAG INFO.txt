Apriltag Research:

-------------

Apriltags are small, QR code-like images that can be scanned. They can be in the shapes of circles, squares
or various custom shapes. 

Most AprilTags have IDs attached to them, and the tag family that is being used this year has a total of 587 possible ID codes. An
AprilTag in the current family this year (36h11) contains a square with 10x10 pixels, with a outer borders of all white pixels, and an inner
border of all black pixels.

AprilTags, when scanned using the new SDK, can provide position and rotation orientation. However, gaining such 
information can only be obtained when scanning a flat AprilTag.
